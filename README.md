VIM-TODO
========
A simple syntax file for the manipulation of TODO lists.

This project was originally forked from [TaskPaper.VIM](https://github.com/davidoc/taskpaper.vim).

Installation
=============
Unpack the package into your .vim directory.

Or unpack into ~/.vim/bundles if using Pathogen.

File-type Plugin
=================
The file-type plugin tries to make editing TODO lists in Vim more comfortable.

Vim can complete context names after the '@' using the keyword completion
commands (e.g. Ctrl-X Ctrl-N).

The plugin defines some new mappings:

    \td     Mark task as done
    \tx     Mark task as cancelled
    \tt     Mark task as today
    \tD     Archive @done items
    \tX     Show tasks marked as cancelled
    \tT     Show tasks marked as today
    \t/     Search for items including keyword
    \ts     Search for items including tag
    \tp     Fold all projects
    \t.     Fold all notes
    \tP     Focus on the current project
    \tj     Go to next project
    \tk     Go to previous project
    \tg     Go to specified project
    \tm     Move task to specified project

Note: if `<Leader>` has been changed (e.g. `:let mapleader=",,"`) then its value should be used instead of `\` in the mappings.

Marking a task as done will add the "@done" context tag to the end of the task, and it will be greyed out by the syntax file.

To show all tasks with a particular context tag, type `\ts` and a tag name to search.  If you use the `\ts` command over the desired context tag, the tag name is set as default value.  This will fold all the irrelevant tasks leaving only the tasks in the current context visible.

To fold all top-level projects leaving only the headings visible use the `\tp` command. Standard fold commands can be used to open (`zo`) and close (`zc`) individual projects.

To show all projects and tasks use the `zR` command. This disables folding so that the entire file is expanded.

To go to next or previous project use the `\tj` command or `\tk` command.  To go to a project you specify use the `\tg` command.  You can complete project names with <Tab> on prompt.


Configuration
==============
The plugin supports a number of configuration variables, which can be set in
your .vimrc file.

To change the default date format string used when marking a task complete,
define the `todo_date_format` variable. The format matches your system's
`strftime()` function.

For example, to include the date and time in ISO8601 format:

    let g:todo_date_format = "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z"

To change the default archive project name, define the
`todo_archive_project` variable.  The default value is "Archive".

    let g:todo_archive_project = "Archive"

By default, when you move a task, the cursor will follow that task to its new
location.  To make the cursor stay in it's current location, change the
`todo_follow_move` variable.

    let g:todo_follow_move = 0

If you want to hide done tasks when searching you can change the
`todo_search_hide_done` variable.

    let g:todo_search_hide_done = 1

To set a custom style (colour, bold, etc.) for tags todo_styles variable,
which is a dictionary.

    let g:todo_styles={'wait': 'ctermfg=Blue guifg=Blue', 'FAIL':
'ctermbg=Red guibg=Red'}

See |highlight-args| for a full description of the syntax.


File-type Detection
====================
This package also contains a script to automatically use the TaskPaper file type for all files with the ".todo" extension.


Customize
==========
You can create your own shortcut for tagging.  To define your own shortcut, write settings in ~/.vim/ftplugin/taskpaper.vim or ~/.vimrc.  If you use the .vimrc file, define settings like:

    function! s:todo_setup()
    " Your settings
    nnoremap <buffer> <silent> <Leader>tn
    \    :<C-u>call todo#toggle_tag('next', '')<CR>
    endfunction

    augroup vimrc-todo
    autocmd!
    autocmd FileType todo call s:todo_setup()
    augroup END

To add a tag without argument:

    nnoremap <buffer> <silent> <Leader>tn
    \    :<C-u>call todo#add_tag('next', '')<CR>

To delete a tag:

    nnoremap <buffer> <silent> <Leader>tN
    \    :<C-u>call todo#delete_tag('next', '')<CR>

To toggle a tag:

    nnoremap <buffer> <silent> <Leader>tn
    \    :<C-u>call todo#toggle_tag('next', '')<CR>

To add a tag with an argument:

    nnoremap <buffer> <silent> <Leader>tq
    \    :<C-u>call todo#add_tag('priority')<CR>

You can specify the priority value on prompt.

To delete the priority tag with any argument:

    nnoremap <buffer> <silent> <Leader>tQ
    \    :<C-u>call todo#delete_tag('priority', '')<CR>

To delete only the level 1 of priority tag:

    nnoremap <buffer> <silent> <Leader>tQ
    \    :<C-u>call todo#delete_tag('priority', '1')<CR>

To toggle a tag with an argument:

    nnoremap <buffer> <silent> <Leader>tq
    \    :<C-u>call todo#toggle_tag('priority')<CR>

To update a tag (not delete if the tag exists):

    nnoremap <buffer> <silent> <Leader>tq
    \    :<C-u>call todo#update_tag('priority')<CR>

The initial version of the ToggleDone() function was based on SwitchBox()
from the VimOutliner Checkboxes script written by Noel Henson (available
from <http://www.vimoutliner.org>).

Context folding expression was based on a snippet from Vim Tip 282
(<http://vim.sourceforge.net/tips/tip.php?tip_id=282>).
